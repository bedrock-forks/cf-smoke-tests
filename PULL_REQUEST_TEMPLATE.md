*Note: We want to keep cf-smoke-tests as lean as possible. The suite's purpose is to reveal fundamental problems with a foundation after initial or upgrade deployment. 
If your new test is executing anything more sophisticated than validating core functionality of Cloud Foundry, [CF Acceptance Tests](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-acceptance-tests) (CATs) may be more suitable home for it (although CATs are designed to be run as part of a development pipeline and not against production environments).
